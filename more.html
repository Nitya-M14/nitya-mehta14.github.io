								<h2>My experiences:</h2>
								<p>I worked at Code Ninjas as a code instructor for about a year and half.
									As a coding instructor, I worked directly with the students to help guide them through the Code Ninjas
									curriculum and teach them problem-solving skills. I helped them gain confidence and new skills
									including coding, math, and logic, as they progressed from white to black belt.</p>
									<p>I just started my journey as a Software Engineer Fellow. I am going to build 5+ AI apps APIs using OpenAI, StripeAPI, Next JS, and Pinecone. Iâ€™ve worked on projects from
										start to finish, collaborating with 3+ engineering peers. We used MCCV design patterns to guide our
										development process.Coached by Amazon, and Capital One engineers on Agile, Bloomberg, Git, and microservice
									patterns.</p>
								<h2>Languages </h2>
								<p> I am fluent in both English and Hindi, being a native speaker of both languages. Furthermore, I have developed 
									competency in Spanish, allowing me to communicate effectively and navigate various situations in that language as well.</p>
